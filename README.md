# Overview
* What is source control and why is it important.
* Touch on other source control options and hosts.
* Source control is one aspect of professional deploy cycle -- works hand in hand with continuous integration and the code review process.
* It's more than just checking in code, it's leaving a breadcrumb trail for ourselves and our partners to understand how and why we constructed things the way we did.

# Review
* Review of basic git idiom
* Companion to existing best practices around "test a little, write a little."
* Gets stuff off your machine!
* Build your portfolio for interviewing!

## Review of basic git idiom
|Git Command       |Summary     |
|------------------|------------|
|`git status`        |see status of local repo, what's changed, what's committed, what's new|
|`git pull`          |get most recent commits from the branch you are on|
|`git add <filename>`|this file or all changes in this file to staging|
|`git commit -m`     |combine all things in staging into a commit bundle with this message on my local machine|
|`git push`          |push all of my local commits up to the remote branch on the remote repo|


## Some Tips and Tricks
|Git Command       |Summary     |
|------------------|------------|
|`git add -p`       |cycle though all tracked files and inspect changes one at a time|
|`git diff`          |show me, line by line, what has changed in tracked files that aren't added|
|`git diff --cached` |show me, line by line, what has changed in added files|
|`git commit --amend`|alter the commit message of a staged commit|


***

# How it Improves Your Workflow
* Check out the log, see that you've left yourself some notes
* Gives you lots of break points. 'git reset' to previous working commit.

## Git Log
|Git Command       |Summary     |
|------------------|------------|
|`git log`           |show long form commit info|
|`git log --pretty=oneline`| show short form commit info|
|`git reset --hard <some commit id>`|turn back time on my local machine to some previous commit id|
|`git reset --hard HEAD~{<number of commits back>}`|turn back time on my local machine to some number of commits back|

# For Your Team/Professionally:
* Requires a plan, communication, and requirements beforehand. Usually branches and pull requests are small and centered on a specific goal like implementing a feature

## Git Flow
## Fork and Pull
![http://blog.ieeesoftware.org/2015/12/variability-management-using-github.html](assets/fork_and_pull.png)

|Git Command       |Summary     |
|------------------|------------|
|`git remote -v`| see the verbose name of my remote|
|`git remote show <shortname>`| detailed info on your remote |
|`git remote add <shortname> <url>`| explicitly add a remote and assign a name|
|`git fetch <remote>`| contribute to a specific remote|

## Branch Management
### branch creation idiom
|Git Command       |Summary     |
|------------------|------------|
|`git branch <some branch name>`|create a branch on your local machine|
|`git push -u origin <some branch name>`|push your local branch to the remote, set remote upstream|
|`git branch`|see all my local branches|
|`git checkout <some branch name>`|switch to a local branch|

### branch management commands
|Git Command       |Summary     |
|------------------|------------|
|`git branch -a`|see my local and remote branches|
|`git checkout --track origin/<some remote branch name>`|get a remote branch on your local machine|
|`git branch -d <some local branch name>`|delete the local branch|
|`git branch -D <some local branch name>`|force delete the local branch|
|`git push origin :<some remote branch name>`|delete a remote branch|

## Pull Requests
* See [github documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for the hows
* Hallmarks of a good PR conversation:
  * PRs are opened with meaningful titles and descriptions where needed.
  * Reviewers are specific when requesting changes.
  * Addresses both the trivial (style, naming) and non-trivial (logic and architecture).
  * Nice! Remember, this person is trying to make your code better.
  * Every concern is at least discussed.
  * Resolved quickly. Try to not pick up new work until your PR is merged.

## Merging and Resolving Merge Conflicts
|Git Command       |Summary     |
|------------------|------------|
|`git merge <some local branch name>`|apply commits from some other the local branch to the current branch you are in|

## The Stash
|Git Command       |Summary     |
|------------------|------------|
|`git stash`|put any tracked changes into stash|
|`git stash save "<some note about what is stashed>"`| leave yourself a note about what you are stashing |
|`git stash list`|see a list of what is stashed|
|`git stash pop`|take the first item off the top of the stash|
|`git stash clear`|wipe out the stash|

## Rebasing
|Git Command       |Summary     |
|------------------|------------|
|`git rebase <some local branch name>`|alter history. replay all of my commits on top of current local version of some other branch. Must `git push -f` (force push to commit to remote) to apply this to the remote|

## Squashing
|Git Command       |Summary     |
|------------------|------------|
|`git rebase -i <some local branch name or commit id>`|alter history. combine commits, delete commits, reword commit messages. Must `git push -f` (force push to commit to remote) to apply this to the remote|

## The Reflog
|Git Command       |Summary     |
|------------------|------------|
|`git reflog --all`|see the history of branches across the whole repo

# For Open Source Contributions:
* Branches are used to manage not just feature creation, but also the life cycle and continued development of many projects.
* Shout out to open source projects like the development of Rust and Ember http://2016.phillyemergingtech.com/session/stability-without-stagnation-lessons-learned-shipping-ember/.
